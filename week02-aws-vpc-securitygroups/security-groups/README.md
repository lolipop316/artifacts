# AWS VPC Phase 2 â€” Web to DB Isolation

### Summary
In this phase I built on the first VPC setup and added a second instance to create a two-tier design.  
The goal was to have one web instance in the public subnet and one database instance in the private subnet.  
Only the web instance should talk to the database, and no one else should be able to reach it from the internet.  
I used Security Groups to control the traffic between the two.

### Reflection
This lab helped me understand how to isolate private resources in AWS.  
The database only accepts traffic from the web instance, not from the internet.  
It showed how security groups act like firewalls at the instance level.  
I also practiced testing network connections and checking service status through the terminal.

### Next Steps
In the next phase I will rebuild this setup using Terraform to automate the network and instance creation.
